libMesh-specific configuration options
======================================

For generic installation instructions refer also to the file INSTALL.


METHODS
-------

libMesh supports the notion of multiple methods - that is, compilation
settings used to build the library.  The major methods supported by
the library are:

    opt: Fully Optimized mode, with little to no error checking. No debugging
         symbols are included in the resulting library.  Agressive optimization
	 flags are used.
    
    dbg: Full debugging mode - all useful compiler warnings are enabled,
         as well as robust internal state checking.
	 
  devel: Use high levels of compiler optimization, but also enable internal
         state checking.  Debugging symbols are included, but the resulting
	 code is not always easy to navigate in a debugger because of
	 compiler optimizations.

    pro: Optimized code path with compiler flags suitable for use with gprof.

  oprof: Optimized code path with compiler flags suitable for use with oprofile.


To select a set of methods, you can pass them to configure in one of two ways:

$ ./configure --with-methods="opt dbg devel"

or

$ ./configure METHODS="devel oprof"

If unspecified, the three METHODS="opt dbg devel" are default.
