User the upstream Makefile to rebuild the fpoptimizer.cc file (only necessary after changes to source files in the ./fpoptimizer directory)

> rm .dep fpoptimizer.cc
> make -f Makefile.orig fpoptimizer.cc

Note that the upstream Makefile is patched to add the include path necessary to find libmesh_config.h
