What is this?
-------------
A set of GNU Octave (may also work with Matlab?) scripts for making
plots of the usage statistics for libMesh over time.  Some information
is only available if you have a password...


libmesh_all.m          - Run to regenerate all the plots.
libmesh_downloads.m    - Number of downloads per month as reported by sourceforge.net
libmesh_mailinglists.m - Approximate subscriber counts and mailing list volume, organized
                         chronologically and by month.  Subscriber counts require a password.
libmesh_sflogos.m      - The number of sourceforge "logos" served up due to libmesh web content.
libmesh_svn.m          - SVN usage for libmesh.  This is now deprecated because we don't use SVN
                         anymore.
libmesh_citations.m    - Numbers of publications per year, thesis/dissertations and preprints.
                         Numbers are a byproduct of generating the publications.php page, see
                         doc/citations for more information.
libmesh_pagehits       - Number of visitors to the libmesh pages on sf.net, as reported by
                         Google Analytics.  Note: you will need a google account (and I will
                         have to give it access) to get these numbers.


Obviously, most of these statistics are Sourceforge-specific and need
to be updated now that we have moved to github.  The hope is that by
checking this in, other people might think of something new to plot.

It would be really nice to have more data on github site traffic: How
may people have fetched?  How much data was pushed/pulled?  We have
rudimentary Google Analytics set up for the README file, but there is
a lot that only github knows...
